## üõ†Ô∏è Steps

The lab was built on a **Hyper-V** virtualization platform and includes multiple **virtual machines (VMs)**, **virtual switches**, and a **pfSense** virtual firewall/router to manage traffic and enforce network segmentation.

I've created the following network diagram to have a better understanding of the structure and functionality.

Here's a breakdown of the components along with a high-level step-by-step overview of the setup process, without diving deep into every single detail.

### 1. Internet and Host PC

First of all, the home router connects to the internet and provides an external connection. The Host PC acts as the virtualization platform running Hyper-V, hosting all virtual machines and virtual switches.

To use virtualization platforms like Hyper-V, we need to ensure that virtualization is enabled in the BIOS of the machine. I chose this platform because it allows running multiple operating systems as virtual machines and, in my experience, it optimally allocates resources within a Windows environment.

### 2. Virtual Switches and Subnets

The first step in setting up this network was creating the virtual switches within the Hyper-V platform. These switches form the foundation of the network, segmenting it into four distinct subnets, as illustrated below.

*Virtual Switch WAN*

This virtual switch connects the pfSense firewall to the home router, enabling machines in other subnets to access the internet, hence we will select the switch type as external as seen below.

To create different switches for each subnet, open Hyper-V Manager on the Host PC, and then open the Virtual Switch Manager under the Actions tab.

*Virtual Switch LAN* 

This virtual switch is configured as an internal type and it hosts the Kali Linux VM (10.0.1.47). The next three subnets are also configured as internal and are named accordingly.
