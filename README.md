### CyberSec-HomeLab

## Objective

Create a cybersecurity homelab designed for learning, testing and experimenting in cybersecurity, networking and system administration while maintaining a secure and isolated environment.

## Skills Showcased

### Virtualization Skills
- Proficient in setting up and managing virtual machines.
- Allocated resources (CPU, memory and storage) to virtual machines for optimal performance.
### Networking Skills
- Subnetting: Designed and implemented multiple subnets. 
- Routing: Configured pfSense to route traffic between subnets and the internet.
- Firewall Management: Created firewall rules in pfSense to control traffic flow between subnets and external network.
- Network Isolation: Ensured secure communication between isolated virtual switches.
### System Administration Skills
- OS Administration: Installed and managed Windows Server, Windows clients, and Linux systems.
- Configured Windows Server 2019 as a Domain Controller.
- Managed user accounts, groups and permissions in Active Directory.
- Configured DNS and AD Certificate Services.
- Connected client machines to the domain.
### Monitoring and Logging
- Created a dedicated monitoring VM to track network activity, analyze logs or monitor system health.
- Installed and configured Splunk Enterprise. 
### Documentation and Design
- Created detailed network diagram to document the architecture.
- Wrote this technical documentation for setup replication.

## Tools Used

- Hyper-V Manager 
- pfSense virtual firewall and router
- Splunk Enterprise 
- Microsoft Visio for designing the network diagram

## Steps

The setup I've built on a Hyper-V virtualization platform includes multiple virtual machines (VMs), virtual switches and a pfSense virtual firewall/router to manage traffic and ensure network segmentation.
I've created the following network diagram to have a better understanding of the structure and functionality.

Here's a breakdown of the components along with a high-level step-by-step overvie of the setup process, without diving deep into every single detail.
