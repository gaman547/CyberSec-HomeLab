## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Walkthrough

The lab was built on a **Hyper-V** virtualization platform and includes multiple **virtual machines (VMs)**, **virtual switches**, and a **pfSense** virtual firewall/router to manage traffic and enforce network segmentation.

I've created the following network diagram to have a better understanding of the structure and functionality.

*Ref 1: Network Diagram*

Here's a breakdown of the components, followed by a high-level overview of the setup process, without diving deep into every single detail.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Internet & Host PC

The **home router** connects to the internet and provides outbound access. The **Host PC** runs **Hyper-V**, serving as the base virtualization platform where all virtual machines and virtual switches reside.

> üí° Before using Hyper-V, ensure that **virtualization is enabled in BIOS**. Hyper-V is preferred here due to its seamless integration with Windows and efficient resource management.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Switches and Subnets

The network setup begins with creating **virtual switches** in Hyper-V, which form the segmented subnets of the lab. These provide isolation and simulate real-world network zones.

#### üåê Virtual Switch - WAN

This **external switch** connects pfSense to the home router, enabling internet access. It's configured in Hyper-V as an *External* type.

> üí° To create different switches for each subnet, open Hyper-V Manager on the Host PC, and then open the Virtual Switch Manager under the Actions tab.

*Ref 3: WAN*

#### üîí Virtual Switch - LAN

This **internal switch** connects the Kali Linux VM (10.0.1.47). Additional subnets are also created using internal switches to ensure complete segmentation.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ pfSense Firewall and Router

The **pfSense firewall** serves as the central hub for routing and security within the homelab environment. Deployed as a virtual machine on **Hyper-V**, it manages traffic between the WAN and multiple internal subnets, ensuring network segmentation and control.

I navigated to https://www.pfsense.org/download/ and downloaded the latest version of iso image using the below specifications.
