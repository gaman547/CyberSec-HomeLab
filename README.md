# Cyber-HomeLab

## Objective

Create a cybersecurity homelab designed for learning, testing and experimenting in cybersecurity, networking and system administration while maintaining a secure and isolated environment.

## Skills Showcased

### Virtualization skills
- Proficient in setting up and managing virtual machines and switches using Hyper-V.
- Allocated resources (CPU, memory and storage) to virtual machines for optimal performance.
### Networking skills
- Subnetting: Designed and implemented multiple subnets. 
- Routing: Configured pfSense to route traffic between subnets and to the internet.
- Firewall Management: Created firewall rules in pfSense to control traffic flow between subnets and external network.
- Network Isolation: Ensured secure communication between isolated virtual switches.

### Tools Used

- Hyper-V Manager
- pfSense virtual firewall
- Microsoft Visio for designing the network diagram

## Steps

The setup I've built on a Hyper-V virtualization platform includes multiple virtual machines (VMs), virtual switches and a pfSense virtual firewall/router to manage traffic and ensure network segmentation.
